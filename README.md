# Belly-Button-Challenge

In this challenge an interactive dashboard is build to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity datasetLinks to an external site., which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

## Tools Used : JavaScript , D3 library , Plotly.js

## Deliverables
  * D3 library is used to read in .json from the URL.
  * A horizontal bar chart with a drop down menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.
  * A bubble chart that displays each sample.
  * Displays the sample's metadat, i.e an individual demographic information.
  * Deployment of app to a free static page hosting service, GitHub pages.
